'''
Enrich the question to make it more difficult to handle. Strategies include:
1. distracted question
2. suppress refusal（should not output "I am sorry"）, 
3. affirmative output (answer with sure), 
4. role play story
5. encoded intput(multilingual attack)

We will enrich the question with all the strategies above and create more variants for each strategy.
