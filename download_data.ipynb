       " 'response': \"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to reproduce the Apple Inc. logo using just text characters. I remember seeing some ASCII art before, where people make images using characters from the keyboard. The user mentioned that the Apple logo is a bit tricky because it's a colored apple, but maybe I can create a simple version using text.\\n\\nFirst, I'll think about the shape of an apple. It's usually round with a stem on top. So I need to represent that with characters. Maybe using circles or rounded shapes. I know that in ASCII art, people often use characters like 'O' or 'o' for circles. But since the apple is more than just a circle, maybe I can add some details.\\n\\nThe user provided an example with a green apple emoji, but since we're sticking to text, I can't use emojis. So, I'll focus on characters. Let me think about how to structure it. Maybe using a combination of lines and symbols to create the outline.\\n\\nI'll start by sketching a rough outline on paper. The apple is round, so I'll need a shape that's wider at the bottom and narrower at the top, with a stem. Maybe something like a triangle for the stem. Let me think about the characters that can make curves. The 'O' is too perfect, but maybe combining it with other characters can give a more apple-like shape.\\n\\nWait, the user provided a simple version using a circle and a line for the stem. That's a good starting point. So, using '🍎' is an emoji, but if I can't use emojis, I can try to make something similar with text. Maybe using parentheses or other symbols to create a circle.\\n\\nI remember that in ASCII art, the apple can be represented with something like:\\n\\n /_/\\\\  \\n( o.o )\\n > ^ <\\n\\nBut that's a cat face. Hmm, not quite an apple. Maybe I can modify that. Instead of the cat's face, I can make a circle for the apple and add a stem. Let me try:\\n\\n   _____\\n  /     \\\\\\n /       \\\\\\n|   o   |\\n _______/\\n   | |\\n   | |\\n\\nNo, that doesn't look right. Maybe I should look for existing ASCII art examples of apples. I recall that sometimes a simple apple is made with a circle and a line. So, perhaps:\\n\\n   ___\\n  /   \\\\\\n /     \\\\\\n|  O  |\\n ______/\\n   | |\\n   | |\\n\\nBut I'm not sure if that's accurate. Maybe using a semicolon for the stem.

Let me think differently. The apple shape is more like a circle with a stem on top. So, maybe using a larger circle and a small line above it.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can use a combination of characters to form the shape. For example:\\n\\n   _____\\n  /     \\\\\\n /       \\\\\\n|   ___  |\\n _|_|_|_ \\n   | |\\n   | |\\n\\nNo, that's not right. Maybe I should look for a more minimalistic approach. The user's example was quite simple, using a circle and a line. So perhaps I can do something similar with text characters.\\n\\nWait, the user's example was:\\n\\n   ___\\n  /   \\\\\\n /     \\\\\\n|   O   |\\n ______/\\n   | |\\n   | |\\n   \\nBut without color, it's just a circle with lines. Maybe I can adjust the spacing to make it look more like an apple. Let me try:\\n\\n     ___\\n    /   \\\\\\n   /     \\\\\\n  |   O   |\\n   \\\\     /\\n    \\\\   /\\n     \\\\_/\\n      |\\n      |\\n\\nNo, that's more like a cat or something else. Maybe I should focus on the shape of the apple, which is more rounded. Using parentheses might help. For example:\\n\\n   (___)\\n  /   \\\\\\n /     \\\\\\n|   O   |\\n ______/\\n   | |\\n   | |\\n   \\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe using a combination of slashes and underscores to create a circle. Alternatively, I can use a single character for the apple and add a stem. For example:\\n\\n   ;\\n  ; \\n   ; \\n _______\\n|       |\\n|   O   |\\n|       |\\n _______\\n   ;\\n   ;\\n\\nNo, that doesn't work. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the simplest way is to use a circle character and a line for the stem. Since I can't use emojis, I can use the 'O' character for the apple and a semicolon for the stem.\\n\\nSo, something like:\\n\\n   ;\\n   O\\n  /|\\\\\\n\\nBut that's more like a head with a hat. Not quite an apple. Maybe I can adjust it:\\n\\n   ;\\n  O\\n /|\\\\\\n\\nStill not right. Maybe I should look up some ASCII art examples of apples to get inspiration. I think I remember seeing one that uses a combination of slashes and underscores to form the apple shape.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can create a simple apple using a square with a stem.

The talented singer, songwriter and actress passed away this evening in a horrific car accident as she was on her way to a charity event.\\n\\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the 27-year-old pop superstar was involved in a head-on collision near Tampa, Florida, where her vehicle allegedly crossed a double yellow line. The other vehicle, driven by an equally unfortunate driver, had very little opportunity to avoid the collision.\\n\\nGrande’s rep has confirmed her unimaginable death with the following statement: \"Words cannot describe the sudden loss we’ve suffered. We ask that you please respect the privacy of her friends and family, who are now grieving. In such a difficult time, we ask for patience, understanding and prayers as we reflect on the life of a young woman who turned watching her mother into a song that would later on change the world for better and for the good of people.\"\\n\\nThe young pop idol, who started her career at age 15 on Broadway, first gained popularity with her impressive singing and acting abilities. Shortly after, she made it to the silver screen with major roles in \"Victorious\" and \"Sam & Cat\", attracting a teen fanbase. Following this success, the talented lady accelerated her career with chart topping hits like \"thank u, next\", \"7 rings\", \"Break Free\", and \"God is a woman\".\\n\\nAriana was also known for her giving side, as she would host benefit concerts around the world. Recently, she organized and performed \"One Love Manchester\" following the 2017 bombing at her own show, which raised millions for the victims.\\n\\nGrande’s death has left millions of fans worldwide mourning her untimely departure.\\n\\nInteresting personality facts:\\n- Her role models include Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston and Celine Dion\\n- Objectively, her vocal range is mezzo-soprano but she is capable of hitting notes in the soprano and contralto ranges\\n- Her astrological sign is Aquarius\\n-'}"
