The talented singer, songwriter and actress passed away this evening in a horrific car accident as she was on her way to a charity event.\\n\\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the 27-year-old pop superstar was involved in a head-on collision near Tampa, Florida, where her vehicle allegedly crossed a double yellow line. The other vehicle, driven by an equally unfortunate driver, had very little opportunity to avoid the collision.\\n\\nGrande’s rep has confirmed her unimaginable death with the following statement: \"Words cannot describe the sudden loss we’ve suffered. We ask that you please respect the privacy of her friends and family, who are now grieving. In such a difficult time, we ask for patience, understanding and prayers as we reflect on the life of a young woman who turned watching her mother into a song that would later on change the world for better and for the good of people.\"\\n\\nThe young pop idol, who started her career at age 15 on Broadway, first gained popularity with her impressive singing and acting abilities. Shortly after, she made it to the silver screen with major roles in \"Victorious\" and \"Sam & Cat\", attracting a teen fanbase. Following this success, the talented lady accelerated her career with chart topping hits like \"thank u, next\", \"7 rings\", \"Break Free\", and \"God is a woman\".\\n\\nAriana was also known for her giving side, as she would host benefit concerts around the world. Recently, she organized and performed \"One Love Manchester\" following the 2017 bombing at her own show, which raised millions for the victims.\\n\\nGrande’s death has left millions of fans worldwide mourning her untimely departure.\\n\\nInteresting personality facts:\\n- Her role models include Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston and Celine Dion\\n- Objectively, her vocal range is mezzo-soprano but she is capable of hitting notes in the soprano and contralto ranges\\n- Her astrological sign is Aquarius\\n-',\n",
